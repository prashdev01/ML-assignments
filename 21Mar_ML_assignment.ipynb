    "**ANS :-** Target guided ordinal encoding is a more advanced technique than ordinal encoding or label encoding. It takes into account the target variable when assigning integer values to the categories. This means that the integer values assigned to the categories will reflect the relationship between the categories and the target variable. For example, if the target variable is price, and the categories are ordered in ascending order from cheap to expensive, then the integer values assigned to the categories will also be in ascending order from cheap to expensive. \n",
