This correlation can lead to unstable coefficient estimates, inflated standard errors, and challenges in interpreting the significance of individual predictors.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting:**\n",
    "   - Polynomial regression models with high degrees can be prone to overfitting, capturing noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. This can lead to poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Increased Complexity:**\n",
    "   - As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more complex. More complex models may be harder to interpret and may not generalize well to new data.\n",

    "3. **Avoiding Overfitting:**\n",
    "   - In situations where the available data is limited, avoiding overfitting may favor the use of simpler linear models.\n",
