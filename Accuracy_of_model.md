# There are diferent ways to calculate the accuracy of the machie learning model 

## some of them are the `R-squereed and Adjusted R-squered` methods 

* **R - Squered** =  1 - ssRes / ssTotal 
* Notations : 
    1. ssRes =  sum of squere resideal   
    2. ssTotal =  sum of squere Total

## suppose we have graph of that has a best-fit line ploted 
from the graph the Resideal is nothing but the diffrence between the predicted point and the actual point, also called as error
SSRes = is the sumestion of the squere resideal

for the SSTotal is the avarage of the line y and diffrence between point (the error between the actual and the avarage of y line)

SSTotal =  is the sum of the squere of total
