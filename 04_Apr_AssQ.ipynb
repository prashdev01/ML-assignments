It works by recursively partitioning the feature space into regions, where each region corresponds to a simple prediction rule or class label. The decision tree splits the feature space based on the feature that maximizes the purity of the resulting partitions, aiming to minimize the impurity or uncertainty in the class labels of the data points within each partition."
