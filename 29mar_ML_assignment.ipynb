    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that incorporates regularization by adding a penalty term equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This differs from other regression techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) by penalizing large coefficients, effectively performing variable selection and shrinking coefficients towards zero simultaneously."

    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter (lambda or alpha). Increasing lambda increases the strength of regularization, leading to more coefficients being pushed towards zero, thereby increasing model sparsity. However, too high a value of lambda may cause underfitting, so it's important to tune it appropriately."
